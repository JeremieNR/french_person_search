# french_person_search
A parsing algorithm written in Python to find people who died in France from 1970 to 2021 based on name, birth, location, etc. Currently it is set to find people with the last name "MICHET".

The text files that I would parse are too large to upload on GitHub, so they can be found at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/fichier-des-personnes-decedees/
